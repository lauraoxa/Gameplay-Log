# Gameplay Log

## What is it?

A little React App for:

* cataloguing your consoles
* cataloguing your games
* keeping track of your game time for the fun of it
  
## What it does?

Manually insert your consoles, games, and then start logging your game time. In statistics, there are some counters for daily, monthly, and annual (current and previous year) game times. You can also see overall play time for each console and game.

## Where does it live?

## What happens next?

Not much? I might come back to tweak this, especially if I start using it and desire more functionality. For the time being, the app is what it is; a school project I'm semi-proud of how it turned out. (If you want to give it a spin, go on ahead! Just sign up with your Google account and start exploring.)
